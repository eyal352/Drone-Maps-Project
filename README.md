# The Drone Strike Project
==================================

The Drone Strike Project is a webapp designed to help visualize U.S. military drone strikes across Africa and the Middle East.

 It was built using data from the [dronestre.am API](http://dronestre.am") in addition to articles linked from [Wikipedia](https://www.wikipedia.org) and [The Bureau Investigates](https://www.thebureauinvestigates.com/). This project is completely open source and you can see and contribute to the code here on [Github](https://github.com/eyal352/Drone-Maps-Project).

The Drone Strike Project can be viewed live via [this](http://www.eyalchistik.com/Drone-Maps-Project/) link.
Use the search bar to input a year between 2006 and 2016, or the country of Somalia, Yemen, or Pakistan to get a better sense of where, when, and how often U.S. drone strikes occur.

Technologies used include Javascript, jQuery, Google Maps API, Knockout.js, Bootstrap, and Jasny Bootstrap.
